# Asteroids Multiplayer

LAN deathmatch multiplayer for up to 8 players. Didactic client-server project in Python with `asyncio` and WebSockets. Fork of [asteroids_single-player](https://github.com/jucimarjr/asteroids_single-player) — the parent repository is frozen at `v0.1.0` and this fork starts from the same state.

A single-player mode runs from this repository too: every multiplayer-prep refactor leaves `python main.py` working as in the parent repo.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.10 or newer (3.13 recommended via `.python-version`).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Run multiplayer deathmatch

```
# Terminal 0 — copy the example token file first
cp tokens.example.txt tokens.txt

# Terminal 1 — server with two rooms
python -m server --rooms 2 --port 8765

# Terminals 2-5 — players in two rooms
python -m multiplayer.player --host localhost --port 8765 --name Alice --room 0 --token dev-token-1
python -m multiplayer.player --host localhost --port 8765 --name Bob   --room 0 --token dev-token-2
python -m multiplayer.player --host localhost --port 8765 --name Carol --room 1 --token dev-token-3
python -m multiplayer.player --host localhost --port 8765 --name Dave  --room 1 --token dev-token-4

# Terminal 6 — spectator on room 0
python -m multiplayer.spectator --host localhost --port 8765 --room 0 --token dev-token-1 --width 1024 --height 768
```

The server prints one line per significant event to stdout, so the terminal doubles as a live transcript of the match:

```
asteroids server listening on ws://0.0.0.0:8765
ship spawned: Alice (pid=1, room=0)
ship spawned: Bob (pid=2, room=0)
match started: room=0
ship killed: Bob (pid=2, room=0)
match ended: room=0, winner=Alice
```

The server is authoritative and runs each room's `World` headlessly at 60 Hz; each client connects, receives snapshots at 30 Hz, sends input every frame (players only), and renders through the same client renderer used by single-player. The networked player client adds a local HUD with score, deaths and room id plus a scoreboard listing every connected player in the same room, with a `RESPAWN X.Xs` countdown shown next to anyone waiting to respawn. Audio starts **muted** on the networked client; press `R Shift` in any player window to toggle SFX on or off.

A match begins as soon as two players are connected to a room (`MIN_PLAYERS_TO_START`); it ends on the first to 5 frags or after 2 minutes of clock (`FRAG_LIMIT`, `MATCH_DURATION` in `core/config.py`). Any connected player presses `ENTER` on the match-end screen to reset that room's world and start the next match. Rooms are independent — matches in room 0 do not affect room 1.

The spectator client is read-only: it never spawns a ship, never sends input, and fits the entire 3840×2160 world into the configured `--width`/`--height` window via the `SpectatorCamera` (letterbox padding when the aspect ratio differs from the world's 16:9). Set `--rooms N` on the server to host N concurrent rooms; the default is 1, which matches the F4 single-room behavior.

## Controls

| Key       | Action |
| --------- | ------ |
| `←` `→`   | Rotate |
| `↑`       | Thrust |
| `↓`       | Shield (3 s active, 10 s cooldown) |
| `Space`   | Shoot  |
| `L Shift` | Hyperspace (costs 250 points) |
| `R Shift` | Toggle audio (networked client only; muted at start) |
| `Enter`   | Restart match after `MATCH OVER` (networked client only) |
| `Esc` `Q` | Quit |

## How it works

Four top-level packages, each with a single concern:

- [`core/`](core/) holds game state, entities, collisions, and the per-frame update. Plain Python, no pygame. Emits string events (`"player_shoot"`, `"asteroid_explosion"`) that consumers react to.
- [`client/`](client/) wires pygame to the simulation. Maps input, runs the 60 FPS loop, renders polygons, plays audio from `world.events`.
- [`server/`](server/) hosts the authoritative `World`. Runs the simulation at 60 Hz and broadcasts a snapshot to every connected client at 30 Hz over a single WebSocket per client.
- [`multiplayer/`](multiplayer/) is the networked player. Connects to a server, applies snapshots to a local read-only `World`, sends input every frame, renders through the existing `client/` renderer.

The single-player path (`python main.py`) uses `core/` + `client/` directly and is preserved across every phase. The multiplayer path (server + multiplayer client) layers `server/` + `multiplayer/` on top without touching the others.

See [`docs/teaching/`](docs/teaching/) for the lecture material that walks through each phase.

Key files:

- [`core/world.py`](core/world.py): simulation tick, wave spawning, score, lives, deathmatch flag, respawn loop, match lifecycle.
- [`core/entities.py`](core/entities.py): `Ship`, `Asteroid`, `Bullet`, `UFO`, `Particle`.
- [`core/collisions.py`](core/collisions.py): `CollisionManager` resolves every collision in a single pass and returns a `CollisionResult`.
- [`client/game.py`](client/game.py): game loop and scene transitions (menu, play, game over).
- [`client/spectator_camera.py`](client/spectator_camera.py): scaled fit-the-world-into-the-window camera used by the spectator client.
- [`multiplayer/hud.py`](multiplayer/hud.py): networked-client HUD and scoreboard.
- [`multiplayer/spectator.py`](multiplayer/spectator.py): read-only spectator client.
- [`server/auth.py`](server/auth.py): token allowlist loader.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| F1 — Foundation | Decouple `core/` from pygame, viewport vs world split, camera, testing infra | done |
| F2 — Server lonely | WebSocket asyncio server, single player connects and sees own state | done |
| F3 — Multi-player 1 room | N players in deathmatch, respawn, frag/score, scoreboard HUD | done |
| F4 — Match lifecycle | Timer / frag limit / match end, ENTER-to-restart, lobby gate | done |
| F5 — Multi-room | Token allowlist, N concurrent rooms, dedicated spectator client | done |
